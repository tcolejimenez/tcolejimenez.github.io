<p class="text-justify">The path to programming started with realizing I could create <strong>something out of nothing</strong>
    in an instant.
    I was immediately hooked. </p>

<p class="text-justify">My first programming language, <strong>Java</strong>, gave me a way to explore all the concepts I had
    floating around my head- I had been thinking in a modular or object-oriented way my whole life, I just
    didn't know it. </p>

<p class="text-justify">Next I stared exploring the web and all the magical things it can do, adding <strong>HTML</strong>,
    <strong>CSS</strong>
    and <strong>Javascript</strong> to my toolkit along the way.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Recognizing this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I continued learning all could,
    including
    how to work from the server side with <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>, how to make
    things even prettier
    with <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and storing everything for safe keeping with <strong>Git</strong>.</p>
